## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job here Alicia. Your purpose, audience, goals, persona and use case are all clearly defined. Your directory structure and GitHub repository all look great, and your HTML is very good. Your Milestone One passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Nice work!

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
Your Use Case is good and detailed, but it is more akin to an actual Interaction Flow with pages and features  already planned out. Right now our Use Case is just about clarifying your main user's goals. 

For example, if I expand upon your Step 0... I can suppose that Jennifer's immediate goal is to evaluate your candidacy for an open web dev position at her small company (<50 employees), and she needs to be able to see if you meet the qualifications to warrant a follow up. We can get even more detail if we say that this is a jr. or mid-level position, or if it is a position that includes marketing or copywriting, or database administration, mobile app development, etc. (And ultimately, this use case should circle back to serving YOUR goals for what kind of opportunities you want to attract, since this project is being built for you! :D)

Bear in mind we haven't planned out what pages to build yet - that process (Site Map) is a part of Milestone 2.
 
Additional hint: Beware of spaces between your HTML attributes. Ideally, HTML attributes and values have no spaces between them. See below.
